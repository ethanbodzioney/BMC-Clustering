## A 2D force graph visualization of Bacterial Microcompartment Loci Clustering

![](./example.png)
This repository contains an implementation of Axen's BMC loci clustering algorithm [^1] in python, visualized with a [2D Force Graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph).

To run this just pull down the repository and host the `index.html` file.
